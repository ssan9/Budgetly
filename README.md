## Introduction

A Web App where users would be able to keep a track on their Finances by Budgeting.They will get a feedback on whether they are safe in the budget scale-on the basis of their savings or are over spending their income. They can also keep a track on their expenses month-wise, so that they get an idea about how much they have been spending monthly. They can add new data, remove or update if there's a change, or just see their monthly expenses.

This App has been developed with the help of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Node and Express. Also, mLab is used to store data and Heroku has been used for deployment.

Ajax has been used to make asynchronous requests to get, delete, post or update data from the server. Some plug-ins are also included for additional features, such as Moment.js to set the date's format.
